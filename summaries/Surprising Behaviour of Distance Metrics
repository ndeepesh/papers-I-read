Surprising behaviour of distance metrics in high dimensional space.
Here is the paper - https://bib.dbvis.de/uploadedFiles/155.pdf

TODO: Go through the math described throuroughly.
1. Key takeaway in this paper is that, for high dimensional datasets choice of distance metric becomes very crucial.
2. As the number of dimensions increase, we lose the idea of proximity.
3. So higher the norm, bad would be the results. Thus L1 norm is better suited as distance metric in high dimensions.
4. Paper goes a step forward and introduces fractional norms (technically they are not norms since they cannot be interpreted as distance metrics)
5. They show that these fractional norms help achieve better results in tasks like k-means which is highly dependent on distance between points interpretation
